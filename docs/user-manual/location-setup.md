## Step 2: Fill in Location Details

| Field | Description | Example / Notes |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Location Code (`loc_code`)** | Unique code for the location. Can be a string. | `001` |
| **Location Name** | Name of the location. | `Main Warehouse` |
| **Location Phone** | Contact number (optional). | `+971 50 123 4567` |
| **Concept Code** | Default concept code for POS/menu. If the menu is straightforward, select **All**. Otherwise, assign a code like `001`. Must be **3 characters**. | `001` |
| **Currency** | Currency used for product pricing in this location. | `AED`, `LKR` |
| **Address Line** | Optional address details. | `123 Main St` |
| **Country / City / Area** | Optional location details. | `UAE / Dubai / Marina` |

> ⚠️ **Note:** Concept code is required to link with division and price groups later.

## Step 3: Add Multiple Locations (Optional)

If you need to add a large number of locations:

1. Use the **Upload to Excel** button.  
2. Download the template.  
3. Fill in all locations in the template.  
4. Re-upload the completed file to create multiple locations at once.  

> This method saves time if you have many locations to set up.

## Step 4: Create Division and Concept Codes

1. Once a location is created, a **Division icon** will appear.  
2. Click the division to open the **Concept Tab**.  
3. Add the **default concept code**:  
   - If `001` was added in the location, add `001` here as well.  
   - Price group can remain empty for now (will be added in the next step).  

---

## Step 5: Add Sub-Locations

1. Select the location and navigate to **Sub-Locations**.  
2. Add a **default sub-location**:  
   - This is used for **Inventory operations** such as GRN, stock transfers, etc.  

> ⚠️ **Tip:** Proper setup of sub-locations ensures smooth inventory management for this client.

### Key Notes

- **Default Concept Code**: Required for linking location → division → price group.  
- **Default Sub-Location**: Required if inventory modules (GRN, stock) are active.  
- **Currency**: Determines how prices appear in product master.  
- Excel upload is useful for bulk location creation.
